    <string name="app_principle">Operating principle:\n\n1. Compile *.java files into *.class class files. \n2. Use Google's R8 | D8 tool to compile the *.class file into a *.dex file that the Android platform can run. This step can be de-sugared, and the high-version JDK syntactic sugar can be run on the Android platform. The internal implementation is basically still the syntactic sugar converted into low-version compatible code. \n3. Load the *.dex file into the application through DexClassLoader, and look for the main method reflection call. \n4. Input System.in and output System.out of the proxy system. </string>
